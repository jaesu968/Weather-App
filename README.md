React Native Platform-specific Considerations Lab: Weather App
A well-built, native-feeling app doesn’t just function well—it looks and feels right at home on every device. This weather application project focuses on developing cross-platform skills with React Native.

In this project, you’ll work as a React Native developer building a weather app that adapts to its environment. The starter code provides the groundwork—your task is to improve its experience by tailoring the app’s look and behavior to iOS and Android alike.

You’ll focus your work with a handful of key files, learning to:

Utilize Platform to detect and react to the user’s device.
Create platform-specific components, ensuring your app works well on iPhone, Android, or anywhere else it’s running.
Implement styling tweaks that respect platform conventions and user expectations.
Handle safe areas and spacing differences across devices, keeping your UI clean and user-friendly.
Whether you perfectly match the sample design or put your own spin on things, this project demonstrates how React Native bridges platforms while maintaining a native, polished feel.
